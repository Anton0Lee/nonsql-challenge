Data analysis - Challenge 12 
Working with Mongo in python this time.  
This repo includes a Resources folder whcih contains the Database. The NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb contains the code which imports the Database to mongo then is exported to VSC, it is also used to add a new set of data to the database.  
In the NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb, it contains queries to find the requested data from the database which is then presented as Pandas Dataframes.  
This challenge is faily simple and straightforward. Once you know how to perform the queries then it can be done. One thing to note would be we need to look through the database to make sure we are referring to the correct text in the queries and database.
